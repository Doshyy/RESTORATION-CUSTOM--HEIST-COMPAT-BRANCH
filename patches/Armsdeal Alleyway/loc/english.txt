	"heist_Armsdeal Alleyway_brief" : "For your first job, I need you to intercept an ongoing deal between a gang, which is our potential customer and a rival arms dealer. Those guys have always been a pain in the ass, so with this we are hoping to win the customer over. Your mission is simple, just get there and cause some trouble. Make it look like the dealers tried to rip them off, so take the money and the guns with you. I heard about an increase in police patrols in that area, you probably get company as soon as the whole thing begins so make sure to come prepared. Good luck."

	"contact_shepherd_desc" : "Shepherd is an associate of a big german weapon manufacturer. Little is known about him or his background. He's in charge of expanding the company in the underground scene. Because his field of work is on the not-so-legal side, he can't hire people directly, so he's resorting to CRIME.NET for help, often improvising as the heist is already running. His jobs usually include moving firearms and sabotaging rival arms dealers."

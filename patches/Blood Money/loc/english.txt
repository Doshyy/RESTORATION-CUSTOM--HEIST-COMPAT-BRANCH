Now the Jackals are planning on trading the objects in for a cash reward in their office downtown. You'll be going in to pose as buyers for a classic drug deal prior that evening. Once the 'deal' is done and you find an opening, mask up and get to work. You need to stay silent: If they notice that you are trying to mess with them, we won't be able to pin them for what they did.",

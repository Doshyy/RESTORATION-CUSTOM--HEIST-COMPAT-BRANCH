But, he ain't here to provide the briefing, blame it on old lady luck and her game of unfortunate events. Now aside from the unfortunate circumstances due to Bain's current absence, I'm gonna brief you on news of a hidden vault that ive manage to catch wind of. Its a real beauty, sitting in plain site with one hell of a pay day in it. Before you start thinking this is all about some pile regular old cash, imma stop you right there and say that the red diamond in there, now that's gonna benefit everyone far more than some cash, alright? Say you're all in, and ill reward you handsomely. Sounds solid don't it? We pull this through, I get the diamond, and you get all the loot you want that's in that nice looking vault on top of my payout."

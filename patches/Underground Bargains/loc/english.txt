	"UB_sub_police_2_1" : "Uh, okay? Look, you better tell them to get on the line when I call back in three minutes. I have no fucking clue what's going on in that place but I've got a hunch the Feds are gonna be interested in it."
	"UB_sub_police_2_2" : "Really? You expect me to believe that? Listen pal, if I don't hear anything from them when I call back later, I'm gonna let the sheriff know what's going on, and I'm sure he'd love to pass it onto the FBI. You got three minutes."
	"UB_sub_police_2_3" : "I... you know what? No! I'm fed up with the shady shit always going on over there. I don't even know why we allow two of our officers being assigned to guarding your store, so you better get them on the phone when i call back, or else I'm passing all this shit onto someone who'll actually do something about it. Three minutes is the length of my patience, understood?"
	"UB_sub_police_2_4" : "*sigh* You know, this whole arrangement has been extremely suspicious from the start, and frankly we've been waiting for a warrant to raid the premises for the past week anyway.

	"UB_sub_police_3_1" : "Guess who it is? It's Deputy Rhodes again. Where the fuck are they?"
	"UB_sub_police_3_2" : "Deputy Rhodes again. Time's up, where the hell are they?"
	"UB_sub_police_3_3" : "This is Deputy Rhodes. Are they available now?"
	"UB_sub_police_3_4" : "I'm afraid your three minutes is up! Can I speak to my officers now?"
	"UB_sub_police_4_1" : "Ah, I see. Very well. I guess I'll have to pass this onto someone who's actually going to do something about this now! Goodbye."
	"UB_sub_police_4_2" : "Yeah... no. I'm alerting the FBI."
	"UB_sub_police_4_3" : "Yeah, well, tough shit buddy! Looks like the Feds actually have something to do today!"

	"UB_sub_contractor_s_3" : "Great, it seems like one of them is moving, they seem visibly upset. Go see the clerk."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_4" : "Okay, now regroup discreetly inside the gambling hall."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_5" : "Now we just need to find the vault, and see how we can open it."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_6" : "That's the vault, it seems like we need a three part code. Might wanna check around to find that code. Good luck."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_7" : "Oh, you found a digit. That could be useful for the vault."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_7_1" : "One digit found."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_8" : "Another digit found."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_9" : "We got the full code. Enter it in one of the keypad, and hope to open the right one. It's a single use code so be careful."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_9bis" : "Here's the backup code, open the other door with it."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_10" : "Perfect, we're nearly in guys."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_10bis" : "Thats the wrong door, we need to open the other one. I'm sure the boss' computer must have some backup."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_11" : "And of course there's another alarmed door! Find and disable any security boxes you can find. That should do it."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_11bis" : "And you already took care of the security boxes, nicely done. Go in there then."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_12" : "Okay, you disabled a security box."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_12bis" : "All the security boxes are down."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_13" : "Now that you got that moose... Just BURN IT! He won't recover this time."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_14" : "He's gonna cry for days when he finds out about this. Collect all the loot you want, seems like front cops are moving, so only press that button when you are ready to escape!"
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_15" : "They are waiting for you, there's no way to escape without taking care of them. The van is ready to leave."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_16_1" : "24/7, How may we may help you tonight?"
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_16_2" : "24/7, How..."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_17_1" : "Hmmm.... The guys went to their car.... They seem to be working on their radio... I can't leave the store, but I'll try to get them on the line."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_17_2" : "Yeeaaah.... The guys went to the porta potties, they should be back shortly... I can't leave the store alone, but I'm sure they will be back soon."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_17_3" : "No, I haven't seen them since your last call, I hope..."
	"UB_sub_contractor_s_18" : "Great job, he will not recover anytime soon from his loss, this will play in my interest in near future."

	"UB_sub_contractor_l_1" : "Okay, see if you can fiddle with this weirdly placed electric box."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_2" : "Okay thats not enough. It's got backup power from the grid, you need to take out the others boxes."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_3" : "Ah, it worked. Okay, it seems you can now open the door yourself from the clerk counter."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_4" : "Go find the vault."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_5" : "We're gonna need to override the keypads from a computer. We first need to deactivate security measures. Find and disable the security boxes."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_9" : "Okay, search any computer. One of them should contain an override option for me to use."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_10_1" : "Wrong computer, try another one."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_10_2" : "No luck, we're gonna need to try another one."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_10_3" : "Nothing on there, next one please."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_10_4" : "Some useless junk, patch me into another computer."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_10bis_1" : "Great, I got the override info I needed. Hack one of the door terminals and let's hope for the best."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_10bis_2" : "Okay, I've got backup override infos too. Get back to those doors."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_12" : "One more gate to go. Shouldn't take long"
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_14" : "Oh he's gonna cry for days when he finds out about this. I'm sending you the escape vehicle, prepare any loot you want to take with you."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_14bis" : "Escape coming in less than a minute."
	"UB_sub_contractor_l_15" : "That wasn't as smooth as I planned, but he won't recover anytime soon from this. This will play into ny interest in my near future. Thank you very much."
